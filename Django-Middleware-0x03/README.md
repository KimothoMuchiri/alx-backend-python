## Overview
Middleware is a powerful feature in application design that acts as a bridge between the request and response phases of the application cycle. In this project, learners will explore the concept of middleware, learn how to write custom middleware, and implement logic such as request interception, permission enforcement, request data filtering, logging, and more. Learners will also examine real-world use cases, such as authentication and rate-limiting, and understand the best practices when integrating middleware into a Django application.

This hands-on project will guide you in building a series of middleware components for an Airbnb Clone or similar web application, allowing them to understand middleware’s role in clean architecture and modular backend development.

#### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

- Understand the concept and lifecycle of middleware in Django.
- Create custom middleware to intercept and process incoming requests and outgoing responses.
- Filter and modify request/response data at the middleware level.
- Implement access control mechanisms using middleware.
- Use middleware to enforce API usage policies like rate limiting or request validation.
- Integrate third-party middleware and understand Django’s default middleware stack.
- Apply best practices for organizing middleware logic in a scalable project.
#### Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion, learners will:

- Define and explain how Django middleware works within the request/response cycle.
- Write and integrate custom middleware in a Django project.
- Use middleware to enforce permissions and restrict access based on roles, IP, or headers.
- Filter and clean incoming request data before reaching the views.
- Log request and response metadata for auditing or debugging purposes.
- Separate concerns effectively using middleware rather than overloading views.
- Evaluate the trade-offs and limitations of using middleware for certain functionalities.
